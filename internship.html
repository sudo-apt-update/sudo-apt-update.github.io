	<h1>Internship!</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
		During the summer of 2020, I worked at <a href="https://new.assistments.org/" target="_blank">ASSISTments@WPI</a>! Unfortunately, it couldn't be in-person, but I was able to continue remotely!
	</p>
	<p>
		I'll write more about my summer sometime, but I've gotten the opportunity to work on DRIVER-SEAT@ASSISTments with Dr. Anthony Botelho through the school year, which is even more exciting!
