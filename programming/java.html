				Java
			</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I started learning Java in sophomore year, when I took AP Computer Science A. I had originally not wanted to have much to do with Java, both because I had already learned and loved Ruby, and the syntax for Java was intimidating, to say the least. Others told me that Java would soon be part of the past.
